# Control Repo

This repository is a template control-repo that can be used with r10k as part of
my sample Foreman / Puppet / PuppetDB setup.

The major points are:
 - An environment.conf that correctly implements:
   - A site directory for roles, profiles, and any custom modules for your organization.
   - A config_version script.
 - Provided config_version scripts to output the commit of code that your agent just applied.
 - Basic example of roles/profiles code.
 - hieradata directory with common.yaml and nodes directory.

## Copy This Repo Into Your Own Git Server

### GitLab

1. Install GitLab.
 - https://about.gitlab.com/downloads/

2. After GitLab is installed you may sign if with the `root` user and password `5iveL!fe`.

3. Make a user for yourself.

4. Make an SSH key to link with your user. Youâ€™ll want to do this on the machine you intend to edit code from (most likely not your Puppet master, but your local workstation or laptop).
 - http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/ssh/README.html
 - https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/

5. Create a group called `puppet` (this is case sensitive).
 - http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/workflow/groups.html

6. Add your user to the `puppet` group as well.

7. Create a project called `control-repo`, and set the Namespace to be the `puppet` group.

8. Clone this control repository to your laptop/workstation:
 - `git clone <repository url>`
 - `cd control-repo`

9. Remove this repository as the origin remote:
 - `git remote remove origin`

10. Add your internal repository as the origin remote:
 - `git remote add origin <url of your gitlab repository>`

11. Push the production branch of the repository from your machine up to your git server
 - `git push origin production`
